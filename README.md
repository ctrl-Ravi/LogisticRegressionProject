## Overview

The goal of this project is to build a Logistic Regression model to predict the outcome of a given dataset. Logistic Regression is a statistical method for analyzing a dataset in which there are one or more independent variables that determine an outcome. The outcome is measured with a dichotomous variable (in which there are only two possible outcomes).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/ctrl-Ravi/LogisticRegressionProject.git


2. Install the required packages: pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

1. Run the Jupyter Notebook: jupyter notebook LogisticRegression.ipynb


2. Execute the code cells in the notebook to train and evaluate the Logistic model.

## Deployment

The model can be deployed using various cloud platforms like Heroku, AWS, or Google Cloud Platform.
